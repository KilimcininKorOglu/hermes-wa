# Changelog

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- Update dev Dockerfile base image from `golang:1.24-bookworm` to `golang:1.26-bookworm` so the dev container matches the `go.mod` toolchain and avoids `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` build failures
- Refresh `web/package-lock.json` after running `npm install` inside the dev container

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Webhook delivery retries with exponential backoff (1s/5s/30s) for 5xx responses
- Periodic sweeper goroutine that evicts expired webhook cache entries every 10 minutes
- Version, commit hash, and build date populated into the worker binary via ldflags

### Changed
- Align default Gemini model across code, schema, and frontend to `gemini-flash-latest`
- Cache parsed CORS origins, cookie-secure flag, 9-digit phone flag, and warming worker flag at startup instead of reading env per request
- Paginate list endpoints and strip the session blob from non-admin `/api/instances` responses
- Enable Echo Gzip middleware on API responses
- Restrict uploads listing endpoint to admin role
